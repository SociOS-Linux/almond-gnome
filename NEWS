1.8.0
=====

* It is now possible to control the computer volume using the commands
  of the speaker device ("increase the volume", "lower the volume", "mute",
  "unmute") [#64].
* Launching apps from inside Almond is now possible when Almond is running
  as a flatpak [#41, #42, #64].

============

  at the moment [#58].

  on-disk footprint, and made the app easier to install. As part of this
  change, the wake word is now "computer" [#62].

  significantly improving the voice quality [#62].
* Updated dependencies [#60].

* The flatpak runtime was updated to the latest version (18.08).
* All dependencies in the Almond platform were updated [#20].

  (where provided by the host's PulseAudio).
