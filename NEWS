1.5.0
=====

* The Almond platform was updated to 1.5
* Tensorflow is now built from source, which should improve arch compatibility
* Build issues with mycroft-precise and Keras have been addressed

1.4.0
=====

* The version was bumped to 1.4.0 to align with the 1.4 release of the Almond platform.
* The flatpak runtime was updated to the latest version (18.08).
* All dependencies in the Almond platform were updated [#20].
* The wake word detection module now uses mycroft-precise; this brings a much more
  accurate model, with hopefully fewer false negatives across different speakers. It
  also removes a proprietary component from Almond, which is now fully open source.
* Voice support was improved more generally, including through the use of echo cancellation
  (where provided by the host's PulseAudio).
* Almond now correctly stops speaking when the user says so.
* The app now plays a sound when the wake word is detected, even if the Shell Extension
  is not installed.
* It is now easier to test Almond Desktop in GNOME Builder, without installing.
* The app layout was updated to comply with GNOME 3.32 HIG guidelines, including the
  removal of the app menu.
* It is now possible to update devices from the My Goods page [#34].
* The build system changed to make more use of the CI infrastructure [#33].
* The Almond Shell Extension was improved in its appearance and functionality. It is now stable and
  available on extensions.gnome.org [#30].
* Appstream metadata was updated and now includes OARS ratings [#28].
