# ThingEngine

## Help the World Connect the Dots

ThingEngine is the workhorse behind ThingPedia, the open source platform for IoT rules
that you can execute anywhere you want.

ThingEngine comes in various form:

- As a phone app, for Android
- As an installable app for a home server
- As a web service hosted at <https://thingengine.stanford.edu>
- A GTK+/GNOME app for desktops

This module contains the GNOME version of ThingEngine, and
depends on a number of other modules.

ThingEngine is part of Open Thing Platform, a research project led by
prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.  You can find more
information at <http://thingengine.stanford.edu/about>. User
documentation is available in
[thingengine-core](https://github.com/Stanford-IoT-Lab/thingengine-core).
