# Almond for GNOME

## An Open Virtual Assistant

This repository contains the GNOME/Gtk platform integration layer for the Almond
Open Virtual Assistant.

Almond is a Virtual Assistant that lets you connect to multiple services and 
devices, while respecting your privacy.
Almond is also the only VA to support compound commands, using a powerful research-quality
neural network semantic parser.

Almond comes in various form:

- As a phone app, for Android
- As an installable app for a home server
- As a web service hosted at <https://thingengine.stanford.edu>
- A GTK+/GNOME app for desktops (this repository)

Almond is a research project led by
prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.  You can find more
information at <http://thingengine.stanford.edu/about>. User
documentation is available in
