  <description>
    <p>Almond is a virtual assistant that lets you interact with your services and accounts in natural language, with flexibility and privacy.
    Almond draws its power from the crowdsourced Thingpedia, an open collection of Web and Internet of Things APIs.
    Anyone can contribute support for the favorite service, with few lines of code and a handful of natural language sentences.
    Thingpedia supports more than 100 different services, accounts and IoT devices.</p>

    <release date="2019-04-29" version="1.4.0">
      <description>
        <p>The Almond platform was updated; this brings in several bug fixes and improvements in natural language understanding.</p>
        <p>The UI was updated to comply with the latest version of the Human Interface Guidelines. In particular, the app no longer features an app menu.</p>
        <p>Voice support was revamped and significantly improved, with a brand new wake-word model that should have fewer spurious activations. Almond now emits a sound when the wake word is detected, and correctly stops speaking if so instructed (e.g. by saying “cancel”).</p>
        <p>It is now possible to update skills from the My Skills page (formerly My Goods).</p>
