  <summary>The Open Virtual Assistant</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Almond is a virtual assistant that lets you interact with your services and accounts in natural language, with flexibility and privacy.</p>
    <p>Almond draws its power from the crowdsourced <a href="https://thingpedia.stanford.edu">Thingpedia</a>, an open collection of Web and Internet of Things APIs.
    Anyone can contribute support for the favorite service, with few lines of code and a handful of natural language sentences.
    Thingpedia supports more than 40 different services, accounts and IoT devices.</p>
